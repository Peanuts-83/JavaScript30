    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    let arr2 = [...players];

    console.log(players, arr2)
    players.push('Martin')
    console.log(players, arr2)
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    const team2 = players.slice();
    // now here is the problem!

    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };


    // and think we make a copy:

    const cap2 = {...person}
    cap2.first = 12;
    console.log(person, cap2)
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap3 = Object.assign({}, person, {last:15});
    console.log(cap3)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    person.social = 'cool';
    person.media = {1:'yeah!'};
    const capWrong = {...person};
    person.media = {2:'booh'}
    console.log(person, capWrong)
